 Ep-1 Intro to Node.js

 Where there is Js there will be a Js Engine.
 
 initially Js was ran on spider monkey engine, of mozilla. Eventually it was run on V8 engine of google chrome.

initally it was called web.js, then people got to knoe that we use it anywhere, and not just aweb, so it was named node.js
In 2011, Js supported window, Joyent+Microsoft.
